# WEB GALLERY
A personal collection of **HTML + CSS** projects created as part of my learning journey.  
Each project reflects experiments, customizations, and adaptations based on my own ideas and situations.  
While these projects are simple, they can serve as **references or examples** for anyone starting out with web development â€” for beginners to explore, and build their own versions.

## Projects
- Christmas Invitation


## Note
Each project has its own folder with a dedicated `index.html` file and `style.css`
Only with the directory entirely cloned, you'll be to access these projects locally
